# Widget Concepts in Flutter

This project demonstrates the usage of various Flutter widget concepts, starting from simple to more complex examples.

## 1. Stateless Widget

A **Stateless Widget** is used to create widgets that don't change over time. They are immutable and their properties are set when they are created.

Example: `Text`, `Icon`

## 2. StatefulWidget

A **Stateful Widget** is used to create widgets that can change over time. They maintain a mutable state that can be updated and redrawn as needed.

Example: `TextField`, `Checkbox`

## 3. AppBar

The **AppBar** widget is used to create the top app bar in a Flutter app. It typically contains the app's title and other actions.

Example: App bar with a title and actions.

## 4. Column and Row

**Column** and **Row** widgets are used to arrange other widgets vertically and horizontally, respectively.

Example: Arranging widgets in a vertical or horizontal layout.

## 5. Text

The **Text** widget is used to display text on the screen.

Example: Displaying text content on various screens.

## 6. Image

The **Image** widget is used to display images in a Flutter app.

Example: Displaying images fetched from an API.

## 7. FutureBuilder

The **FutureBuilder** widget is used to asynchronously load and display data in a Flutter app.

Example: Fetching data from an API and displaying it.

## 8. GestureDetector

The **GestureDetector** widget is used to detect user gestures like taps, swipes, and more.

Example: Detecting tap gestures to trigger actions.

## 9. DropdownButton

The **DropdownButton** widget is used to display a dropdown menu with selectable options.

Example: Providing a dropdown menu for user selection.

## 10. ListView

The **ListView** widget is used to display a scrollable list of widgets.

Example: Displaying a list of items fetched from an API.

## 11. Navigator

The **Navigator** widget is used for screen navigation and management.

Example: Navigating between different screens within the app.

## 12. Complex Example

The complex example demonstrates the integration of various widget concepts to create a more interactive and dynamic app, such as handling user input, loading data asynchronously, and navigating between screens.

Example: Weather app with city selection, API data fetching, and dynamic UI updates.
